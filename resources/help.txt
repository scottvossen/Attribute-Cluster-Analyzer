The Attribute & Cluster Analyzer (ACZ) is designed to help us 
determine a best set of attributes for building supervised
learner models. ACZ is easy to use and offers several insights 
into the nature of any dataset to be mined.  In addition 
to its preprocessing capabilities, ACZ can help analyze the 
quality of the clusters created by BpKNetâ€™s unsupervised 
clustering algorithm.  Please review the read me document for 
detailed instructions on how to use ACZ.
